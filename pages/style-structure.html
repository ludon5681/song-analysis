                <p>
                    The style is a mixture of indie rock and folk. The primary identifier of indie rock is the use of sounds, emotions, and subjects that have limited appeal to a mainstream audience (“Indie Rock Music Genre Overview”). Additionally, another characteristic is the maintenance of some independence in creative direction from the label, and a limited interest in doing what is productive or popular, instead having a focus on what is most of interest to the artist (“Indie Rock Music Genre Overview”). However, indie rock is a very broad category, and encompasses many styles, so specific discussion of instruments and feel doesn’t really apply. This song fits into this style primarily because Phoebe Bridgers maintains significant independence in creative direction, and because the song uses sounds and covers emotions that are a step outside what is typically in the mainstream.
                    <br><br>
                    Folk (in this context) is a style of music characterized by performers performing their own material, which tends to be very personal and introspective (“Folk Music Genre Overview”). This music also tends to use acoustic instruments and only one or two voices (though that is not a hard-and-fast rule). 
                    <br><br>
                    The lyrics and feel of the song are very typical of indie rock, with its unconventional reflection on grief, death, and faith. In addition, the song uses an ethereal, slightly disorienting feeling in its instrumentals. Such experimentation is a hallmark of indie rock. The lyrics also fit the folk genre quite well, because they are personal and introspective, but the instrumentation does not fit as well into the folk genre, using some electronic instruments and electric guitar.

                                <li>Strumming pattern remains the same, continues on the same base chord but shifts base note every 8 beats.</li>
                                <li>Vocals enter the song; they sound unfocused, as if the singer is only singing halfheartedly.</li>
                                <li>At about the halfway point in the chorus (at "Drowning out the morning birds [...]"), the chord changes, and a faint and deep synth note (which sounds faintly like a faraway, ethereal choir to me) enters to give the moment gravity. There is also somewhat more atmospheric noise after this point.</li>
                                <li>After this point, the chords change a bit more often, going in a cycle of chord 1, chord 2, chord 3, chord 3.</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Drums enter here.</li>
                                <li>A bass line playing eighths over the chorus enters here. The bass note changes every 4 beats.</li>
                                <li>The vocal line seems to gain slightly more confidence and intention in the chorus.</li>
                                <li>The echo, present through the whole song, becomes much more pronounced in the chorus, especially right at the end of the first half of the chorus.</li>
                                <li>In the second half of the chorus, all of the instrumentation, including the guitar, which has been strumming the same pattern for the whole song, drops away. The echo takes over for a moment.</li>
                                <li>When the vocal line picks up again, it is joined by strings (seemingly one low and one high instrument; possibly a cello and violin) with no other instumentation. This gives this section of the chorus a feeling of peace and serenity in contrast to the tension of the rest of the song.</li>
                                <li>At the end of the chorus ("I want to be wrong [...]), the strings go up to a climax on a high note, and then fall away.</li>

                                <li>The bass also returns, with a similar (possibly more syncopated) bassline.</li>
                                <li>The strings remain, but play a smaller role, mainly coming in during and at the end of vocal lines to accentuate their effect.</li>
                                <li>An electric guitar enters, playing a similar role to the strings. It at times seems to be playing in a call-and-response with the strings</li>
                                <li>The instrumentation ramps up at the middle of the verse ("But you know I'd stand on a corner [...]), becoming louder. The strings begin playing almost constantly, though they are overshadowed by the guitars, drums, and bass.</li>

                                <li>The climax of the last verse ends, and once again all instrumentation falls away except the strings.</li>
                                <li>Additional voices (likely additional recordings of the same voice, actually) come in at "Through the walls [...]" as the song ramps up in intensity again.</li>
                                <li>At this point the drums and bass come back in, but not the guitar playing chords. The electric guitar plays a minor role here, and is relatively quiet.</li>

                                <li>The solo ends and the drums stop abruptly, leaving only the atmospheric noise and reverb for a couple seconds.</li>
