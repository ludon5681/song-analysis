                <p>
                    Phoebe Bridgers is an American singer-songwriter born in Pasadena, California. She first gained prominence in the indie music scene with the release of her debut album, “Stranger in the Alps,” in 2017 (Petrusich). The album was well-received by fans and won her critical acclaim, featuring a mix of indie rock and folk styles and highlighting Bridgers’ emotive vocals and introspective lyrics. She proceeded to create the supergroup Boygenius in 2018 with fellow artists Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker. Boygenius produced 3 songs and an EP in 2018, as well as touring extensively in that year (Petrusich).
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to her work in Boygenius, Bridgers has recorded with a number of other notable artists, including The 1975 and Conor Oberst (Bernstein, Skinner). She has also received a number of accolades for her work, including a Grammy award nomination for best new artist in 2021, as well as recognition from the music industry for her activism on social justice issues, such as her use of her platform to speak out on issues such as climate change and racial inequality (“Phoebe Bridgers | Artist”, Baltin)
                    <br><br>
                    Bridgers is one of the most influential artists of her generation, with her “frank, anxious lyrics” (to quote a profile of her in the New Yorker) being seen by many young people as a welcome reflection of their own uncertainty and anxiety in the face of an uncertain and unstable future (Petrusich). Her music inspires the kind of melancholy that prompts us to wallow; and while it’s sometimes unhealthy, it’s good - and in a strange sense enjoyable - to wallow once in a while.
