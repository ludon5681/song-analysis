                    <h1 id="title">Meaning, Story, and Emotions</h1>
                    <p>The song is heavy with meaning and emotion, being a reflection on grief, faith, and meaning, topics with a lot of heavy emotional weight for many people. The song explores these themes differently in different parts of the song, so I'll be analyzing the lyrics by section. The lyrics will appear on the right, and my interpretation on the left. Scroll down and have a look!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="scrollElement two">
                    <p>The first verse is primarily meant to establish the theme of loss and lack of direction in the song; the idea of “Running around in circles” is used to show a feeling of stagnation, of being lost without an idea where to go from here. The “same three songs over and over” are an extension of this theme, showing that the subject is creatively stuck in the past, looping the same songs without the energy to breach into something new. The line “Hum along till the feeling’s gone forever” is the culmination of that idea: the belief that by losing herself in the way things used to be, the subject can quiet the difficulty of moving on and moving forward.</p>
                </div>
        
                <div class="scrollElement three">
                    <p>The chorus takes a turn into one of the song’s other themes, that being of faith. The stars not being out is a reflection of the subject’s grasping for faith to provide some form of meaning, but not finding any. Instead, she “wish[es] hard on a Chinese satellite,” implying a realization that solace will not come from some outside force like faith; that even when she tries to reach out to faith and religion, there’s nothing there. “I want to believe,” she says, an even more explicit affirmation of this idea. “Instead I look at the sky and I feel nothing.” The subject wishes she could find some relief in faith or religion, but finds herself coming up short. </p>
                </div>
        
                <div class="scrollElement four">
                    <p>The next verse confirms the theme of grief, in talking about someone in the past tense and heavily implying (if not outright stating) their being dead. It also suggests a troubled past experience with faith, saying “You were screaming at the Evangelicals.” However, the song suggests that the subject has begun to gain an understanding of why people hold so strongly to religious beliefs, and even wishes that they could find it in themselves to believe the same:</p>
        
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>“But you know I'd stand on the corner<br>
                        Embarrassed with a picket sign<br>
                        If it meant I would see you<br>
                        When I die”<br></p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>This is my favorite part of this song, at once an expression of grief, understanding, and empathy. However, even all of those combined bring nothing but conflict, as no amount of understanding why people are driven to believe in religion and afterlives can make the subject believe herself.</p>
                </div>
        
                <div class="scrollElement five">
                    <p>The last verse reiterates many of these ideas. For instance, the phrase “Swore I could feel you through the walls / But that’s impossible” implies that the subject sometimes believes, in moments of weakness or vulnerability, that they can feel the presence of their loved one; but because of their lack of faith, quickly writes it off as impossible.</p>

                <div id="lastInterpretation" class="scrollElement six">
                    <p>In general, the song is a reflection on grief, faith, and a broader feeling of lack of purpose. In fact, in an interview with Pitchfork, Bridgers said, in a discussion of cults:</p>
        
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>“That’s kind of what “Chinese Satellite” is about, wishing I could make a leap like that where your life has purpose all of a sudden.”</p>

                        [Verse 1]<br>
                        I've been running around in circles<br>
                        Pretending to be myself<br>
                        Why would somebody do this on purpose<br>
                        When they could do something else?<br>
                        Drowning out the morning birds<br>
                        With the same three songs over and over<br>
                        I wish I wrote it, but I didn't so I learn the words<br>
                        Hum along 'til the feeling's gone forever<br>

                        But they weren't out tonight<br>
                        So I wished hard on a Chinese satellite<br>
                        I want to believe<br>

                        You know I hate to be alone<br>

                        They were screamin' right back from what I remember<br>
                        When you said I will never be your vegetable<br>
                        Because I think when you're gone, it's forever<br>
                        But you know I'd stand on the corner<br>
                        Embarrassed with a picket sign<br>

                        It's just a matter of time before I'm hearing things<br>
                        Swore I could feel you through the walls<br>

                        That if I go outside I'll see a tractor beam<br>
                        Coming to take me to where I'm from<br>
                        I want to go home<br>
